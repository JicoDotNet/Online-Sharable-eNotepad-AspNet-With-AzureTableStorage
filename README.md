#### Azure Table Storage 
Azure Table Storage is a cloud-based service that stores structured NoSQL data, providing a key/attribute store with a schematic design. Itâ€™s part of the Microsoft Azure cloud platform and allows for the storage of large amounts of non-relational data.
Azure Table Storage is ideal for storing datasets that do not require complex joins or foreign keys, such as user data for web applications, address books, and device information.

_Generate the connection string of **Azure Table Storage** from [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)._

> To generate an Azure Table Storage connection string from the Azure Portal, follow these steps:
 1. Navigate to your **storage account** in the Azure Portal.
 2. In the **Security + networking** section, locate the Access keys setting.
 3. Click on the **Show keys** button at the top of the page to display the account keys and associated connection strings.
 4. Copy the **Connection string** provided there.

**The Connection String looks like this:**
``` xml
DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=[yourAccountName];AccountKey=[yourAccountKey]
```
